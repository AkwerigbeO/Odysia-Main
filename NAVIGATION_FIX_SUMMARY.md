# Navigation Layout Fix - Odysia Platform

## Issue Description

**Problem**: When navigating back to previous pages, the layout would get scattered and CSS would go missing, causing visual inconsistencies and poor user experience.

**Root Cause**: Multiple layout files were creating separate HTML documents with duplicate `<html>` and `<body>` tags, causing CSS conflicts and layout issues during navigation.

## Files Affected

### ❌ Before (Problematic Files)
- `src/app/expert-login/layout.tsx` - Had duplicate HTML structure
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Had duplicate HTML structure  
- `src/app/client-login/layout.tsx` - Had duplicate HTML structure
- `src/app/client-dashboard/layout.tsx` - Had duplicate HTML structure

### ✅ After (Fixed Files)
- All layout files now only contain their specific logic without HTML structure
- Single root layout file (`src/app/layout.tsx`) handles all HTML structure

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed Duplicate HTML Structures

**Before** (expert-login/layout.tsx):
```tsx
return (
  <html lang="en" className="scroll-smooth">
    <body className={`${inter.className} transition-colors duration-300...`}>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AuthProvider>
          {children}
        </AuthProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
)
```

**After** (expert-login/layout.tsx):
```tsx
return (
  <AuthProvider>
    {children}
  </AuthProvider>
)
```

### 2. Enhanced CSS for Navigation Stability

Added CSS rules to prevent layout shifts:

```css
/* Prevent layout shifts during navigation */
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Ensure CSS is loaded before content is displayed */
body::before {
  content: '';
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: inherit;
  z-index: -1;
}

/* Navigation transition styles */
.page-transition {
  @apply transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out;
}
```

### 3. Created NavigationWrapper Component

New component to handle smooth page transitions:

```tsx
export default function NavigationWrapper({ children }: NavigationWrapperProps) {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  const [isNavigating, setIsNavigating] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsNavigating(true)
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setIsNavigating(false)
    }, 100)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [pathname])

  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
      <motion.div
        key={pathname}
        initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeInOut" }}
        className={`page-transition ${isNavigating ? 'pointer-events-none' : ''}`}
      >
        {children}
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  )
}
```

### 4. Added CSS Loading Optimization

Enhanced the root layout with critical CSS loading:

```tsx
<head>
  {/* Preload critical CSS */}
  <link rel="preload" href="/_next/static/css/app/layout.css" as="style" />
  <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      /* Critical CSS to prevent layout shifts */
      body { 
        opacity: 0; 
        transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out; 
      }
      body.loaded { 
        opacity: 1; 
      }
    `
  }} />
  <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      // Show body when CSS is loaded
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        document.body.classList.add('loaded');
      });
    `
  }} />
</head>
```
